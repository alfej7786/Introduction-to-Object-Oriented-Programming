After doing the workshop 6 I have learned about copy constructor in which a member function will initialize an object by using another object of the same class and also I have learned and implemented the concept of operator overloading . In my case I used the Basket(Basket &d) and did two kinds of copies  which are shallow copying and deep copying for my values to perform a copy constructor. The other new thing that I learned about was using the ostream as an operator to handle the output stream.
In the milestone part I have learned to take arguments to copy the class instance and create an overload function to add new items wherever necessary. The milestone was harder and took a lot of time as you need to create option to add the menu using the operator constructor and display it. It took me quite a time to figure out how to perform operator overloading but after seeing couple of YouTube videos and practicing I was able to complete this milestone.
