ANSWERS:
To be honest I found this Workshop relatively more straightforward than the previous two workshops. Particularly Part 1 of this Workshop was just a cakewalk, I managed to complete my first part just in about 30-50 minutes. Although Part 2 wasn’t as easy as Part 1. Part 2 was confusing, some of the functions were complicating, and took almost an hour to understand them because in this workshop they didn’t provide more explanation about each function. There was a function that made me struggle a lot, function draw() from BarChart.cpp module is the one that made me use Google to come up with a solution.  The definition of that function is shared below for better clarification. Actually, I had issues with ‘setw’, just realized after got the explanation from the internet.

// Function draw
void BarChart::draw() const  {
    if (isValid())
    {   // print Valid
        cout << m_chartTitle << endl;
        cout << setw(71)<<setfill('-') <<"-"<< endl; // Print '-'
        for (int i = 0; i < m_noOfBars; i++)
        {
            m_bars[i].draw();
        }
        cout << setw(71) << setfill('-') <<"-"<< endl;
    }
    else
    {   // print Invalid
        cout << "Invalid Chart!" << endl;
    }
}
