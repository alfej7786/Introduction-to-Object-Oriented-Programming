ANSWER:
At the beginning of last week’s lecture, I found this topic quite tough to understand(constructors, destructors, and this). Particularly 'this', I was really confused and lost on that part when I started working in this workshop I managed to understand the entire chapter. In the first part (Lab) we were asked to use 'this' so that we can understand the logic. Both parts were easy to understand and straightforward, so I ended up finishing smoothly without any issues. But only part of part 2 (DIY) consumed a lot of time. My program was running properly but when I tried to submit on matrix I used to get an error saying output not matched. Then later realized it needs to be sorted and as usual sorting functions are so hard to implement for me. Went back to the professor’s previous workshop sorting function, and tried to implement using the same logic and managed. Special thanks to Professor Fardad.
